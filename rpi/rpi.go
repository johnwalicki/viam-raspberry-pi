// Package rpi implements raspberry pi board
package rpi

/*
	This driver contains various functionalities of raspberry pi board using the
	pigpio daemon library (https://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/pdif2.html).
	NOTE: This driver only supports software PWM functionality of raspberry pi.
		  For software PWM, we currently support the default sample rate of
		  5 microseconds, which supports the following 18 frequencies (Hz):
		  8000  4000  2000 1600 1000  800  500  400  320
		  250   200   160  100   80   50   40   20   10
		  Details on this can be found here -> https://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/pdif2.html#set_PWM_frequency
